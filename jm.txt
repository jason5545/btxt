The effectiveness of oregano leaves as mosquito killer 


Introduction 
 
Mosquitoes are among the most important vectors of human diseases, causing millions of deaths and disabilities every year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, and lymphatic filariasis account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases globally. Therefore, mosquito control is a vital strategy to prevent and reduce the transmission of these diseases and improve public health. However, the conventional methods of mosquito control based on synthetic insecticides have several drawbacks, such as environmental pollution, insect resistance, human toxicity, and high cost. Hence, there is a need to explore alternative options for mosquito control that are safer, cheaper, and more eco-friendly. 
One of the promising alternatives is the use of natural insect repellents derived from plants. Plants have been used for centuries by various cultures as sources of repellents against insects and other pests. Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites such as essential oils that have insect-repellent properties due to their volatile and aromatic nature. Essential oils are complex mixtures of organic compounds that can affect the behavior and physiology of insects by interfering with their olfactory, gustatory, or nervous systems. Moreover, essential oils are biodegradable and have low toxicity to humans and non-target organisms. 
Among the plants that have been reported to have insect-repellent properties, oregano (Origanum vulgare) is a well-known herb that belongs to the family Lamiaceae. Oregano is widely cultivated and used for culinary and medicinal purposes in many countries. Oregano has also been shown to have antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities due to its essential oil content. The essential oil of oregano contains compounds such as carvacrol, γ-terpinene, and cymene that have larvicidal and adulticidal effects on mosquitoes. However, the effectiveness of oregano leaves as mosquito killers has not been extensively studied or compared with synthetic insecticides. 
Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of oregano leaf extract as a mosquito killer compared to a synthetic insecticide. The specific objectives are: 
- To determine the chemical composition of oregano leaf extract by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses.- To evaluate the larvicidal and adulticidal activities of oregano leaf extract against Culex pipiens mosquitoes under laboratory conditions.- To compare the efficacy and safety of oregano leaf extract with a synthetic insecticide in killing mosquitoes. 
The hypothesis of this study is that oregano leaf extract is more effective than a synthetic insecticide in killing mosquitoes. The expected results are that oregano leaf extract will exhibit a dose-dependent larvicidal and adulticidal activity against Culex pipiens mosquitoes with lower LC50 values than those of synthetic insecticide. The possible implications are that oregano leaf extract could be used as a natural insect repellent for mosquito control that is safe, cheap, and eco-friendly. 
Background of the Study 
Mosquitoes are small insects that belong to the order Diptera and the family Culicidae. They have three pairs of legs, one pair of wings, a pair of antennae, and a long proboscis that they use to suck blood from vertebrate hosts. Mosquitoes undergo four stages in their life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The eggs are laid on water or moist surfaces by female mosquitoes after they feed on blood. The larvae hatch from the eggs and live in water where they feed on organic matter and microorganisms. The pupae are also aquatic and do not feed but undergo metamorphosis into adulthood. The adults emerge from the water and fly in search of hosts for blood feeding or mates for reproduction. 
Mosquitoes are considered vectors or carriers of many diseases that affect humans and animals. These diseases are caused by pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, protozoa, or helminths that are transmitted by mosquitoes through their saliva when they bite their hosts. Some of the most common mosquito-borne diseases are: 
- Malaria: It is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium that infect red blood cells and cause fever, chills, headache, anemia, and organ failure. It is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. According to WHO, malaria affected 229 million people and killed 409 000 people in 2019.- Dengue: It is caused by four types of dengue viruses that infect white blood cells and cause fever, rash, joint pain, bleeding, and shock. It is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. According to WHO, dengue affected 105 million people and killed 22 000 people in 2019.- Zika: It is caused by the Zika virus that infects nerve cells and causes mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle pain. It is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. It can also be transmitted sexually or from mother to fetus. According to WHO, Zika affected 86 countries and territories and caused 2 600 cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformations in 2016.- Chikungunya: It is caused by the chikungunya virus that infects muscle cells and causes fever, rash, joint pain, and swelling. It is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. According to WHO, chikungunya affected 3.4 million people and killed 250 people in 2016.- Yellow fever: It is caused by the yellow fever virus that infects liver cells and causes fever, jaundice, bleeding, and organ failure. It is transmitted by Aedes or Haemagogus mosquitoes mainly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and South America. According to WHO, yellow fever affected 84 000 people and killed 9 900 people in 2018.- Lymphatic filariasis: It is caused by parasitic worms of the genus Wuchereria or Brugia that infect lymphatic vessels and cause swelling, pain, and disability. It is transmitted by Culex, Anopheles, or Aedes mosquitoes mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. According to WHO, lymphatic filariasis affected 120 million people and caused 40 million cases of disability in 2019. 
Mosquito control is essential to prevent and reduce the transmission of these diseases and improve public health. Mosquito control involves various methods such as environmental management, biological control, personal protection, and chemical control. Environmental management aims to eliminate or reduce the breeding sites of mosquitoes by draining or filling water bodies, clearing vegetation, or improving sanitation. Biological control aims to use natural enemies of mosquitoes such as predators, parasites, or pathogens to reduce their population or infectivity. Personal protection aims to avoid or minimize contact with mosquitoes by using physical barriers such as nets, screens, or clothing, or applying repellents on skin or clothing. Chemical control aims to kill or repel mosquitoes by using insecticides that can be applied on water surfaces, vegetation, walls, or skin. 
Among these methods, chemical control based on synthetic insecticides has been widely used for mosquito control for decades. Synthetic insecticides are substances that are artificially produced to kill or repel insects by affecting their nervous system or metabolism. Synthetic insecticides can be classified into different groups based on their chemical structure or mode of action such as organochlorines (e.g., DDT), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), carbamates (e.g., propoxur), pyrethroids (e.g., permethrin), neonicotinoids (e.g., imidacloprid), etc. 
However, the use of synthetic insecticides for mosquito control has several drawbacks that limit their effectiveness and sustainability. Some of these drawbacks are: 
- Environmental pollution: Synthetic insecticides can contaminate soil, water, air, plants, and animals with harmful residues that can persist for long periods and cause ecological imbalance and biodiversity loss. Synthetic insecticides can also affect the quality and safety of food and water sources for humans and animals.- Insect resistance: Synthetic insecticides can induce genetic or behavioral changes in mosquitoes that make them less susceptible or more tolerant to the insecticides. Insect resistance can reduce efficacy and increase the cost of mosquito control. Insect resistance can also facilitate the transmission of diseases by increasing the survival or biting rate of mosquitoes.- Human toxicity: Synthetic insecticides can pose health risks to humans who are exposed to them directly or indirectly. Direct exposure can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact with insecticides during their application or storage. Indirect exposure can occur through the consumption of contaminated food or water or contact with treated surfaces or materials. Synthetic insecticides can cause acute or chronic effects on human health such as irritation, allergy, poisoning, cancer, or reproductive disorders.- High cost: Synthetic insecticides can be expensive to purchase, transport, store, and apply. Synthetic insecticides can also require specialized equipment and trained personnel for their proper use and disposal. Synthetic insecticides can also incur additional costs due to environmental remediation, insect resistance management, or human health care. 
Hence, there is a need to explore alternative options for mosquito control that are safer, cheaper, and more eco-friendly. One of the promising alternatives is the use of natural insect repellents derived from plants. Plants have been used for centuries by various cultures as sources of repellents against insects and other pests. Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites such as essential oils that have insect-repellent properties due to their volatile and aromatic nature. Essential oils are complex mixtures of organic compounds that can affect the behavior and physiology of insects by interfering with their olfactory, gustatory, or nervous systems. Moreover, essential oils are biodegradable and have low toxicity to humans and non-target organisms. 
Among the plants that have been reported to have insect-repellent properties, oregano (Origanum vulgare) is a well-known herb that belongs to the family Lamiaceae. Oregano is widely cultivated and used for culinary and medicinal purposes in many countries. Oregano has also been shown to have antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities due to its essential oil content. The essential oil of oregano contains compounds such as carvacrol, γ-terpinene, and cymene that have larvicidal and adulticidal effects on mosquitoes. However, the effectiveness of oregano leaves as mosquito killers has not been extensively studied or compared with synthetic insecticides.

Conceptual Framework 
 
A possible conceptual framework for the effectiveness of oregano leaves as mosquito killers could be represented by the following diagram: 
The diagram shows that the independent variable is the type of mosquito killer, which has two levels: oregano leaf extract and synthetic insecticide. The dependent variable is the effectiveness of mosquito killer, which has two indicators: larvicidal activity and adulticidal activity. The moderating variable is the concentration of mosquito killer, which has four levels: 6.25 ppm, 12.5 ppm, 25 ppm, and 50 ppm. The intervening variable is the chemical composition of oregano leaf extract, which has three components: carvacrol, γ-terpinene, and cymene. 
The diagram also shows the direction and nature of the relationships among the variables or concepts. The arrows indicate that the type and concentration of mosquito killer affect the effectiveness of mosquito killer. The plus signs indicate that the relationship is positive, meaning that as the type or concentration of mosquito killer increases, so does the effectiveness of mosquito killer. The minus signs indicate that the relationship is negative, meaning that as the type or concentration of mosquito killer decreases, so does the effectiveness of mosquito killer. The chemical composition of oregano leaf extract influences its effectiveness of oregano leaf extract as a mosquito killer. 
The diagram also shows the research hypothesis that oregano leaf extract is more effective than synthetic insecticides in killing mosquitoes. This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the mean mortality rates and LC50 values of oregano leaf extract and synthetic insecticide at different concentrations against Culex pipiens mosquitoes under laboratory conditions.
